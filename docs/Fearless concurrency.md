## Fearless concurrency

Rust is a programming language that is designed to enable fearless concurrency, which means that it is designed to make it easy for programmers to write concurrent code that is both safe and efficient.

One of the main ways that Rust enables fearless concurrency is through the use of lightweight threads, called "green threads," which are managed by the Rust runtime. Green threads are lightweight because they do not correspond directly to operating system threads, and they can be created and switched between quickly and efficiently. This makes it easy for Rust programs to create and manage many threads without incurring a performance penalty.

Here's an example of how to create and use green threads in Rust:

``` py
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        println!("I'm a new thread!");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        println!("I'm still alive!");
    });
    println!("I'm the main thread!");
    handle.join().unwrap();
    println!("The new thread has finished.");
}
```

In this example, we use the `thread::spawn` function to create a new green thread and pass it a closure that contains the code that the thread should run. The `spawn` function returns a `JoinHandle` that can be used to wait for the thread to finish. We then print a message from the main thread and use the `join` method on the `JoinHandle` to wait for the new thread to finish.

Another way that Rust enables fearless concurrency is through the use of shared-state concurrency, which allows multiple threads to access and modify shared data in a safe and controlled way. In Rust, shared-state concurrency is implemented using a system of locks and mutexes that ensure that only one thread can access shared data at a time.

Here's an example of how to use shared-state concurrency in Rust:

``` py
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let data = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let data_clone = data.clone();
    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        let mut data = data_clone.lock().unwrap();
        *data += 1;
    });
    handle.join().unwrap();
    let data = data.lock().unwrap();
    println!("The value of data is {}", *data);
}
```

In this example, we use an `Arc` (atomic reference count) and a `Mutex` to create a shared, mutable value that can be accessed and modified by multiple threads. We use the `clone` method on the `Arc` to create a copy of the `Arc` that can be moved into the new thread, and we use the `lock` method on the `Mutex` to acquire a mutable reference to the shared data. We then modify the shared data and print its value from the main thread.

Overall, Rust's support for fearless concurrency makes it a great choice for building concurrent and parallel systems. By providing lightweight threads and safe shared-state concurrency, Rust helps developers write concurrent code that is both efficient and safe.

## Additional reading:

Threads, locks, and mutexes are important concepts in concurrent programming, which refers to the execution of multiple threads or processes simultaneously.

Threads are independent execution paths within a single program. They can be used to perform tasks concurrently, allowing a program to perform multiple tasks at the same time. In Rust, threads are created using the `std::thread` module, and they are managed by the Rust runtime.

Locks are a mechanism that can be used to protect shared resources from being accessed or modified concurrently by multiple threads. In Rust, locks are implemented using the `std::sync::Mutex` type, which provides mutual exclusion, meaning that only one thread can access the protected resource at a time.

Here's an example of how to use a lock in Rust:

``` py
use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let data = Mutex::new(0);
    let data_clone = data.clone();
    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        let mut data = data_clone.lock().unwrap();
        *data += 1;
    });
    handle.join().unwrap();
    let data = data.lock().unwrap();
    println!("The value of data is {}", *data);
}
```

In this example, we create a new `Mutex` called `data` and initialize it with the value 0. We then create a new thread and pass it a closure that acquires a lock on the `Mutex` using the `lock` method and modifies the shared data. Finally, we join the thread and print the value of the `Mutex`.

Mutexes are a type of lock that can be used to protect shared resources from being accessed or modified concurrently by multiple threads. In Rust, mutexes are implemented using the `std::sync::Mutex` type, which provides mutual exclusion, meaning that only one thread can access the protected resource at a time.

Here's an example of how to use a mutex in Rust:

``` py
use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let data = Mutex::new(0);
    let data_clone = data.clone();
    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        let mut data = data_clone.lock().unwrap();
        *data += 1;
    });
    handle.join().unwrap();
    let data = data.lock().unwrap();
    println!("The value of data is {}", *data);
}
```

In this example, we create a new `Mutex` called `data` and initialize it with the value 0. We then create a new thread and pass it a closure that acquires a lock on the `Mutex` using the `lock` method and modifies the shared data. Finally, we join the thread and print the value of the `Mutex`.

Overall, threads, locks, and mutexes are important tools for building concurrent and parallel systems in Rust. By providing a way to create and manage threads, and a mechanism for protecting shared resources from concurrent access, Rust enables developers to write efficient and safe concurrent code.
