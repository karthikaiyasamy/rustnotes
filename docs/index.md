# Hello world from Rust ðŸ¦€

## What is Rust?
Rust is a systems programming language. What we mean by that?

Systems programming means creating things like system drivers, databases, Bluetooth/BLE interfaces etc. 
Systems programming is usually done using C or C++ and it works exceptionally great but with some problems. 
Those problems are mainly related to memory safety. Rust mainly focuses on memory safety, protection and high performance.
We will start looking at each of those in the following sections.
