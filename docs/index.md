# Hello world from Rust ðŸ¦€

## What is Rust?

<!--  Rust is a systems programming language. What we mean by that?

Systems programming means creating things like system drivers, databases, Bluetooth/BLE interfaces etc. 
Systems programming is usually done using C or C++ and it works exceptionally great but with some problems. 
Those problems are mainly related to memory safety. Rust mainly focuses on memory safety, protection and high performance. -->

Rust is a programming language that is known for its excellent performance. This means that Rust programs can execute quickly and efficiently, making it a great choice for building high-performance systems.

One of the main reasons for Rust's performance is its static type system and ownership system, which allow the Rust compiler to perform many optimizations at compile time. For example, because Rust variables have a fixed type, the compiler can generate more efficient code by knowing exactly what type of data a variable will contain at runtime. Similarly, because Rust's ownership system ensures that data is never accessed after it goes out of scope, the compiler can automatically deallocate memory and eliminate the need for garbage collection.

Another important feature of Rust is its emphasis on memory safety. Rust is designed to prevent common programming errors that can lead to security vulnerabilities and data corruption, such as null reference errors, data races, and buffer overflows. Rust achieves this through a combination of a borrowing and ownership system, a garbage collector, and a range of other safety features.

We will start looking at each of those in detail in the subsequent sections. 

## Rust learning resources
Before we jump in, I like to list some of the resources I used to learn(ing) Rust ðŸ¦€.  

* The best way to learn the language is from what we fondly call "The Book", here https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
* Another fantastic book is "Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development", 2021 edition specifically.
