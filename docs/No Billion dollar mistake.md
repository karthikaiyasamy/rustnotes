No billion dollar mistake

In Rust, the concept of "null" does not exist. This means that Rust does not have a null type or a null value that can be assigned to a variable.

One of the main reasons for this design decision is to prevent null reference errors, which are a common source of bugs in other programming languages. In languages with a null type, it is possible for a variable to be null, which means that it does not refer to any object. If a programmer tries to access a method or field of a null object, it will result in a null reference error.

To prevent null reference errors, Rust has a number of alternatives to the null type. One of these alternatives is the `Option` type, which represents a value that may or may not be present. The `Option` type is defined as follows:

``` py
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

The `Option` type has two variants: Some, which contains a value of type `T`, and `None`, which represents the absence of a value. Here's an example of how to use the `Option` type in Rust:

``` py
fn main() {
    let x = Some(5);  // x is a Some variant containing the value 5
    let y = None;  // y is a None variant
    match x {
        Some(val) => println!("x is some and has value {}", val),
        None => println!("x is none"),
    }
    match y {
        Some(val) => println!("y is some and has value {}", val),
        None => println!("y is none"),
    }
}
```

In this example, we create two variables, `x` and `y`, both of which have the type` Option<i32>`. `x` is a `Some` variant containing the value 5, while `y` is a `None` variant. We use a `match` expression to pattern match on the variant of each variable and print a message depending on the variant.

Another alternative to the null type in Rust is the `Result` type, which represents a value that may be Ok or an error. The `Result` type is defined as follows:

``` py
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

The `Result` type has two variants: `Ok`, which contains a value of type `T`, and `Err`, which contains a value of type `E`. Here's an example of how to use the `Result` type in Rust:

``` py
fn divide(x: i32, y: i32) -> Result<i32, &'static str> {
    if y == 0 {
        return Err("division by zero");
    }
    Ok(x / y)
}


fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = 2;
    let result = divide(x, y);
    match result {
        Ok(val) => println!("result is ok and has value {}", val),
        Err(err) => println!("result is an error: {}", err),
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a function `divide` that takes two integers and returns a `Result` with the result of the division. If the divisor is 0, the function returns an `Err` variant
